# Sketch-from-Image

This project utilizes Python's Turtle graphics library to generate a sketch from any image provided by the user.

## Features

- **Image to Sketch Conversion**: Transforms input images into sketches using Turtle graphics.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Turtle graphics library (usually included with standard Python installations)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aniket-a14/Sketch-from-image.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd Sketch-from-image
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can use `pip` to install any missing dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *Note*: If a `requirements.txt` file is not provided, you may need to manually install required libraries.

## Usage

1. **Prepare Your Image**:
